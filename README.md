# STLs by eins

Collection of STLs i created or edited for my Voron printers.


# Files

| Filename | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| m3_washer.stl | Very simple washer for M3 screws. Can be printed in flexible material to decouple motors. |
| 10mm_strip_mount_longer.stl | LED strip mount for the V0. Based on the original mount by [al3ph](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/blob/master/printer_mods/al3ph/led_mount). Upsized 10 LEDs on each side and also moved the cable channel to the bottom so it is invisible. |
| backpanel_top_only.stl | Small backpanel for the V0. Based on the original panel by [DrGhetto](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/DrGhetto/GhettoPanels). I shortened it so it only encloses the top part above the motors. This one is perfect together with the [electronics separator by Weaslus](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Weaslus/Electronics-Bay-Seperator) to get a enclosed chamber without a complete backpanel. |
| V0_ADXL345_m3x30.stl | ADXL345 sensor mount for the V0. Based on the original file by Discord User 1093i3511#3971. This one uses M3x30 screws to mount, since i didnt have the  required screws for the other one :). It is not corrected for ABS shrinkage, upsizing it by 1.5% gave a working mount for me. |
| z_component_alignment_jig_300mm.stl | Voron Legacy z-alignment jig for a 300mm build plate. Based on the jig that is included with the Legacy STLs, but added 35mm in length so the build plate is still centered. |
| Deck_Panel_Backpack_withSSR.stl | Deck panel backpack for the V0. Based on the backpack by [BlueBear](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/BlueBear/Deck_Panel_Backpack). Added heat set inserts for the cheap chinese SSRs with a Omron G3MB-202P on a PCB. |
